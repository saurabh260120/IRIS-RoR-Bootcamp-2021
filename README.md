# IRIS Ruby on Rails Bootcamp 2021-22
This repository hosts some resources and all of the assignments for the IRIS Ruby on Rails Bootcamp 2021-22.

## Setup

It is suggested to use a system running on Linux or MacOS for the Bootcamp. We understand that most of you may be using a Windows system and have therefore provided a set of instructions to install Linux.

### [Installation Guide for Linux](/INSTALL_LINUX.md)

Once done, you will have to install Ruby and Rails on your system. 

> We recommend sticking to the versions mentioned in the Installation Guide and run commands exactly as instructed, as all assignments in this Bootcamp are tested with these versions.

### [Installation Guide for Ruby and Rails](/INSTALL_RUBY.md)

Next, you'll need to install and have some basic knowledge of Git to submit all assignments.

### [Essential Git](/ESSENTIAL_GIT.md)

With this, you are good to go for the rest of the Bootcamp.

## Schedule

The Bootcamp will follow a schedule of 6 sessions, with each session stretching over 1-1.5 weeks.

### Week 1 - Introduction
The Bootcamp is designed for absolute beginners in the field of Web Development. In the first week, we will introduce you to basic concepts related to Web Development, followed by Ruby and Git.

### Week 2 - Setup
All participants will be given a week to finish basic setup by installing Linux, Ruby, Rails and Git, following instructions given above. An assignment would be given to check if everything has been installed correctly.

### Week 3 - Controllers and Views
Next, we will delve deeper into _Routing_, _Controllers_ and _Views_, and apply some of the concepts we've learnt before. This will be followed by an assignment where we build a simple portfolio website.

### Week 4 - Models
In this week, we will learn more about persisting data using _Databases_ & _Models_. In the assignment, we will work on storing data, to the website built in the previous week.

### Week 5 - Authentication and Authorization
In the final week of this Bootcamp, we will take a look at what Authentication and Authorization is, and how to implement it in Rails. The assignment for this week will add more features to the previous week's assignment that applies concepts learnt this week.
